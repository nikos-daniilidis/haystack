haystack is a library of tools for fooling around with bibliographic data of the American Physical Society. 

The short term goal is to gain familiarity with scientometric data analysis using python

The long term goal is to analyze trends in scientific literature based on bibliometric and text analysis. The project will grow as time allows and our interests evolve. 

APS kindly provided us a large amount of data, but not the permission to publicly post the data on which the code runs. We will be providing snippets of the raw data files so that others can test the code. We also provide a sample of the xml data on which the code works.
