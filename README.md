haystack is a library of tools for exploring bibliographic data of the American Physical Society. 

The short term goal is to gain familiarity with scientometric data analysis using python

The long term goal is to analyze trends in scientific literature based on bibliometric and text analysis. The project will grow as time allows and my interests evolve. 

APS kindly provided a large amount of data, but not the permission to publicly post the data on which the code runs. I will be providing snippets of the raw data files so that others can test the code. I also provide a sample of the xml data on which the code works. 

To find your way through this library, the easiest way will be to look at the IPython notebooks (both ipynb and html formats are included) on your browser. A reasonable sequence would be the following:

1. Look at the parsing functions. The functions are in apsparse.py, and the results are in IPython notebooks with names parse-pr-xml.ipynb etc. 

2. Look at those aspects of the data that I analyze. For exampple, explore-physical-review.ipynb explores trends in publication rates throughout most of the 20th century.

I will expand the above list as the list of projects which have reached some sensible stage of development get completed.
